### **Title:** *"NEON SHADOW: INFILTRATION PROTOCOL"*  
*(A high-stakes cyberpunk text adventure where you hack, fight, and outmaneuver corporate enforcers in a city ruled by AI overlords.)*  

### **Main Characters:**  
- **Player (Codename: Oni)** – A rogue netrunner with elite hacking skills, skilled in deception and stealth.  
- **Nova** – A black-market cyber-doc who supplies illegal augmentations and mission briefings.  
- **Ghost** – A former corporate assassin turned ally, deadly with blades and firearms.  
- **Aegis-9** – A relentless corporate security AI, controlling drones and enforcing corporate rule.  

### **Story Sketch:**  
The year is 2093. The neon-lit sprawl of **Neo-Tokyo Prime** is controlled by the **Zenith Corporation**, 
whose AI overlord, **Aegis-9**, watches over every citizen. 
You, **Oni**, are hired to break into **Zenith’s Data Core** — 
a vault rumored to hold the key to shutting down the corporation’s oppressive surveillance grid. 
With Nova’s intel and Ghost’s combat expertise, 
you must **navigate a maze of security, manipulate the system, and survive the onslaught of drones and cybernetic enforcers**. 
One wrong move, and you’ll be another erased name in the digital void.

### P.S.

Der meiste Code wurde in den Supplierstunden gemeinsam geschrieben oder mit onedrive filshire geteilt. Den Code haben wir jetzt im github repo nochmal in die commits aufgeteilt, um besser zu sehen welcher Codeabschnitt was erledigt.
